Style
- Keep your site simple and elegant
- Avoid bright colors as the backgrounds
- Design for mobile first

Functionality
- Did you validate all inputs? 
    - Is the type correct?
    - Is it within a valid range?
- Do your code meet all the function specs?
- Is the site easy to use?
    - Could you make the number of click less?
    - If the user performs something invalid, Did you provide feedback?
- Prompts are poor way to interact with the user so try to avoid them if possible.
